          <h2>Contrast</h2>
          <p><strong>Contrast is the design principle used
              to make elements look different from each
              other.</strong> With the use of contrast, websites
            can be given a consistent visual language that
            signify the importance and usage of various page
            elements to the user. Color is the most basic tool
            used to create contrast, and distinct color
            palletes, like this dark material color scheme,
            are often used to give websites a consistent
            look.</p>

          <h2>Repetition</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>The principle of repetition is to repetitively use
              the same or similar structure during your
              desgin/development phase.</strong>
            This principle is not trying to make the overall outcome
            boring by repeatedly adding same structure to the design
            instead it helps to make the overall design organized,
            clean and easy to use. Different from the principle of
            contrast, repetition principle actually constitutes the
            main part of the overall project because it ensures the
            consistency of the overall design. For example, in this
            lab we used repetitive section elements to make the
            overall design organized and clean. However, overuse of
            repetition principle will sometimes lead to
            disadvantages. For example, if every stucture of my web
            pages is the same then this will eventually make people
            tiring of it. In summary, use repetition principle
            properly so that it makes your overall design tidy,
            concise and convenient to use.

        <section id="alignment" class="section-img-left">
          <h2>Alignment</h2>
          <p><strong>Alignment is the design principle used to
              create a sense of unity and structure to the
              webpages.</strong>  This principle is often overlooked by
            users, and it's not very apparent that it's there
            until it is gone. Having elements playing
            arbitrarily, or out of alignment is very
            noticeable to the user, and can make a page look
            unprofessional.</p>

        <section id="proximity" class="section-img-right">
          <h2>Proximity</h2>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Principle of proximity simply means to move related
              items closer to each other and unrelated items
              farther apart in order to ahcieve more organized
              result.</strong
                       >
            Users tend to assume that the elements that are
            correlated with each other are close together with one
            another. Conversely, they intuitively assume that
            unrelational elements will be spaced further apart. For
            example, in this lab we put pictures and description
            contents side by side so that audiences can understand
            the meaning of each principle easily. In other words,
            proximity princple assures that users should never have
            to put much effort to understand your design instead
            each elements should be intuitively meaningful by using
            the proximity principle.
