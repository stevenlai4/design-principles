                        Contrast is the design principle used to make elements
                        different from each other, in order to make the elements
                        distinct from each other. Color is the most basic tool
                        used to create contrast. Here's an example of how the
                        material design's basic color pallette creates element
                        separation.

                        <strong
                            >The principle of repetition is to repetitively use
                            the same or similar structure during your
                            desgin/development phase.</strong

                        This principle is not trying to make the overall outcome
                        boring by repeatedly adding same structure to the design
                        instead it helps to make the overall design organized,
                        clean and easy to use. Different from the principle of
                        contrast, repetition principle actually constitutes the
                        main part of the overall project because it ensures the
                        consistency of the overall design. For example, in this
                        lab we used repetitive section elements to make the
                        overall design organized and clean. However, overuse of
                        repetition principle will sometimes lead to
                        disadvantages. For example, if every stucture of my web
                        pages is the same then this will eventually make people
                        tiring of it. In summary, use repetition principle
                        properly so that it makes your overall design tidy,
                        concise and convenient to use.

                        Users tend to assume that the elements that are
                        correlated with each other are close together with one
                        another. Conversely, they intuitively assume that
                        unrelational elements will be spaced further apart. For
                        example, in this lab we put pictures and description
                        contents side by side so that audiences can understand
                        the meaning of each principle easily. In other words,
                        proximity princple assures that users should never have
                        to put much effort to understand your design instead
                        each elements should be intuitively meaningful by using
                        the proximity principle.
